Check out the [website üåê](https://robotology.github.io/robotology-documentation/doc/html)

Here we make available a centralized GH Action that automatically generates the documentation of specific repositories hosted on this organization.
At the time being, we serve the following repositories:
- [`icub-main`](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main)
- [`icub-tutorials`](https://github.com/robotology/icub-tutorials)

If you want to clone this repo locally, remember that it is sufficient to clone the `master` branch only:
```sh
$ git clone --branch master --single-branch https://github.com/robotology/robotology-documentation.git
```
