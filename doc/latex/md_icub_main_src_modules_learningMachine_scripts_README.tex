The Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process for Regression (SSGPR) implementation has been moved to a \href{https://github.com/agijsberts/ssgpr/}{\texttt{ dedicated repository}}. The {\ttfamily tune.\+py} example in that repository covers the functionality that was previously provided in {\ttfamily ssgprtune.\+py}, namely training, hyperparameter optimization, and testing of SSGPR models that can be saved and imported in this {\ttfamily learning\+Machine} module.

For more information on installation and usage, please see \href{https://github.com/agijsberts/ssgpr/}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/agijsberts/ssgpr/}}.
