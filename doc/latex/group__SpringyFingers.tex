Essentially, this framework attemps to model the elastic properties of the distal joints of the fingers by carrying out a calibration stage where the fingers are left free to move in the space while acquiring sensors data. As result, the \char`\"{}springy\char`\"{} relations between the data acquired from motor joint encoders and the distal joints encoders are learnt relying on a Least-\/\+Squares SVM machine from the \mbox{\hyperlink{group__icub__libLM__learning__machines}{Learning Machine}} library. Finally, the model output consists of the metric distance between the vector of distal joints readings as currently acquired and the vector of quantities predicted by the machine.

This method represents a natural extension of the linear technique proposed in the paper\+: \href{http://iit-it.academia.edu/AlexanderSchmitz/Papers/562353/Design_Realization_and_Sensorization_of_the_Dexterous_iCub_Hand}{\texttt{ Design, Realization and Sensorization of the Dextrous i\+Cub Hand}}.
