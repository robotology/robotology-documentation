This module opens a remote\+\_\+controlboard (\href{https://yarp.it/latest/classRemoteControlBoard.html}{\texttt{ https\+://yarp.\+it/latest/class\+Remote\+Control\+Board.\+html}}) for each $<$part$>$ and commands it in position direct control to specific positions received by the input port related to the part.

The position direct control ensure a more reliable repeatability of the movement but on the other hand can be dangerous if used without guards. In this sense this module checks if the jump from the current state of each joint and the target position is not greater of a tolerance. In this case for security reasons it pauses yarpdataplayer, moves the joint(s) in position control for reaching the target, then send a play command to the yarpdataplayer and resume the position direct control. If the reaching of the target fails also in position control, then a fatal error is triggered and the module closes.\hypertarget{group__wholeBodyPlayer_params}{}\doxysubsection{Parameters}\label{group__wholeBodyPlayer_params}
--robot The name of the robot to be controlled (e.\+g icub, icub\+Sim, cer). icub is the default value. --name The prefix to be given to the ports of the module. whole\+Body\+Player is the default value. --parts List of parts to be controlled. It has to be from one to all the following parts\+: \char`\"{}(head torso left\+\_\+arm right\+\_\+arm left\+\_\+leg right\+\_\+arm)\char`\"{}\hypertarget{group__wholeBodyPlayer_ports}{}\doxysubsection{Ports}\label{group__wholeBodyPlayer_ports}
