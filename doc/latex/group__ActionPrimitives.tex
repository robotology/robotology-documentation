The library relies on the Yarp Cartesian Interface and provides the user a collection of action primitives in task space and joint space along with an easy way to combine them together forming higher level actions (e.\+g. grasp(), tap(), {\ucr}) in order to eventually execute more sophisticated tasks without reference to the motion control details.



Central to the library\textquotesingle{}s implementation is the concept of {\bfseries{action}}. An action is a \char`\"{}request\char`\"{} for an execution of three different tasks according to its internal selector\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It can ask to steer the arm to a specified pose, hence performing a motion in the operational space.
\item It can command the execution of some predefined fingers sequences in the joint space identified by a tag.
\item It can ask the system to wait for a specified time interval.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Besides, there exists the possibility of generating one action for the execution of a task of type 1 simultaneously to a task of type 2.

Moreover, whenever an action is produced from within the code the corresponding request item is pushed at the bottom of {\bfseries{actions queue}}. Therefore, user can identify suitable fingers movements in the joint space, associate proper grasping 3d points together with hand posture and finally execute the grasping task as a harmonious combination of a reaching movement and fingers actuations, complying with the time requirements of the synchronized sequence.

It is also given the option to execute a callback whenever an action is accomplished.

To detect contacts among fingers and objects the \mbox{\hyperlink{group__PerceptiveModels}{perceptive\+Models}} library is employed.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
To streamline the code, the {\bfseries{context switching of the Cartesian Interface}} is delegated to the module linking against Action\+Primitives.
